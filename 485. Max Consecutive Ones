/* https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
