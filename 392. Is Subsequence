/* https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/
Given two strings s and t, check if s is a subsequence of t.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters
without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 10^4
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
