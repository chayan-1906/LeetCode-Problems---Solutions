/** https://leetcode.com/problems/harshad-number/description/
An integer divisible by the sum of its digits is said to be a Harshad number. You are given an integer x. Return the sum of the digits of x if x is a Harshad number, otherwise, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: x = 18
Output: 9
Explanation:
The sum of digits of x is 9. 18 is divisible by 9. So 18 is a Harshad number and the answer is 9.

Example 2:
Input: x = 23
Output: -1
Explanation:
The sum of digits of x is 5. 23 is not divisible by 5. So 23 is not a Harshad number and the answer is -1.

Constraints:
1 <= x <= 100

class Solution {
    public int sumOfTheDigitsOfHarshadNumber(int x) {
        int sum = 0;
        int num = x;
        while (num != 0) {
            sum += (num % 10);
            num /= 10;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
        return (x % sum == 0) ? sum : -1;
    }
}
