/* https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/
Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does
not exist, return 0.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: s = " "
Output: 0

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^4
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
